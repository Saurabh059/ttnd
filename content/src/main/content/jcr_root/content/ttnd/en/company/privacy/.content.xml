We also collect data through our partners (customers) who use our Service (including by embedding our code on their websites) to analyze usage of their websites. When you visit such websites, your browser may send us certain information about you as described below. We do not send any promotional emails, however we may send you service related emails related to your account.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;b>&lt;span class=&quot;subheading&quot;>COOKIES INFORMATION:&lt;/span>&lt;/b>&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class=&quot;paragraph&quot;>We may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets learn about your behavior and usage patterns when you are on our site. A cookie may also convey anonymous information about how you browse a partner website to us. A cookie does not collect personal information about you. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser's directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;b>&lt;span class=&quot;subheading&quot;>LOG FILE INFORMATION:&lt;/span>&lt;/b>&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class=&quot;paragraph&quot;>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page on our site.

No personally identifiable information from your TO THE NEW account is collected using these clear gifs. The information is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our Service, and make TO THE NEW better for our users and partners. These technologies mentioned above do not collect personal information about you and only collect data in the aggregate.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;b>&lt;span class=&quot;subheading&quot;>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION:&lt;/span>&lt;/b>&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class=&quot;paragraph&quot;>We use the information that we collect to operate and maintain our Service.

We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers). As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;b>&lt;span class=&quot;subheading&quot;>NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION:&lt;/span>&lt;/b>&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class=&quot;paragraph&quot;>We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain TO THE NEW's services and those of our partners. Non-personally identifiable information may be stored indefinitely.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;b>&lt;span class=&quot;subheading&quot;>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION:&lt;/span>&lt;/b>&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class=&quot;paragraph&quot;>TO THE NEW is concerned with protecting your privacy and data, but we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to TO THE NEW or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our industry standard physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;b>&lt;span class=&quot;subheading&quot;>COMPROMISE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION:&lt;/span>&lt;/b>&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class=&quot;paragraph&quot;>In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, TO THE NEW will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;b>&lt;span class=&quot;subheading&quot;>YOUR CHOICES ABOUT YOUR INFORMATION:&lt;/span>&lt;/b>&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class=&quot;paragraph&quot;>You can review and correct the information about you that TO THE NEW keeps on file by logging into your account to update your password and billing information.
